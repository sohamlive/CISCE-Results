CISCE-Results
=============

It is just a small program I made in Python which will help to get the marks of each and every student who answered ICSE 2013. It will also display the marks in a HTML Format. This program can also generate the Subject Toppers and display it in a HTML format. For this you need to know just the center code. It can literally get the marks of ANY School.He! He!
