CISCE Results Intro
===================

It is just a small program I made in Python which will help to get the marks of each and every student who answered ICSE 2013. It will also display the marks in a HTML Format. This program can also generate the Subject Toppers and display it in a HTML format. For this you need to know just the center code. It can literally get the marks of ANY School. So you get the opportunity to catch any friend (or enemy) of yours who went about propagating his ambigous marks.
